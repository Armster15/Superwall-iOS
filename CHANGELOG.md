# CHANGELOG

The changelog for `Paywall`. Also see the [releases](https://github.com/superwall-me/paywall-ios/releases) on GitHub.


2.3.0 (upcoming release)
-----

### Enhancements
- New [UIKit Example App](Examples/SuperwallUIKitExample).
- Better [SDK documentation](https://sdk.superwall.me/documentation/paywall/). This is built from the ground up using DocC which means you view it directly in Xcode by selecting **Product â–¸ Build Documentation**.
- New Pull Request and Bug Report templates for the repo.
- Added a setup file that installs GitHooks as well as swiftlint if you don't already have it.
- Added a [CONTIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed instructions on how to get set up and contribute to the codebase.
- Added a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file to the repo.
- Removed the `TPInnAppReceipt` dependency.
- Added a CHANGELOG.md file.


### Fixes
- Readme links for the UIKit example app now work.
- Exposes all experiment/variant IDs whenever PaywallInfo is returned in SDK callbacks. This will be useful in the next version of Triggers.
