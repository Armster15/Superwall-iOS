# CHANGELOG

The changelog for `Paywall`. Also see the [releases](https://github.com/superwall-me/paywall-ios/releases) on GitHub.

2.4.0 (upcoming release)
-----

### Enhancements
- New dedicated function for handling deeplinks: `Paywall.handleDeepLink(url)`
- Deprecates old `track` functions. The only one you should use is `Paywall.track(_:_:)`, to which you pass an event name and a dictionary of parameters.
- Adds a new way of internally tracking analytics associated with a paywall and the app session. This will greatly improve the Superwall dashboad analytics.

### Fixes
- Adds the missing Superwall events `app_install`, `paywallWebviewLoad_fail` and `nonRecurringProduct_purchase`.
- Adds `trigger_name` to a `triggerFire` Superwall event, which can be accessed in the parameters sent back to the `trackAnalyticsEvent(name:params:)` delegate function.

2.3.0
-----

### Enhancements
- New [UIKit Example App](Examples/SuperwallUIKitExample).
- Better [SDK documentation](https://sdk.superwall.me/documentation/paywall/). This is built from the ground up using DocC which means you view it directly in Xcode by selecting **Product â–¸ Build Documentation**.
- New Pull Request and Bug Report templates for the repo.
- Added a setup file that installs GitHooks as well as SwiftLint if you don't already have it. This is located at `scripts/setup.sh` and can be run from anywhere.
- Added a [CONTIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed instructions on how to get set up and contribute to the codebase.
- Added a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file to the repo.
- Added a CHANGELOG.md file.
- Removed the `TPInnAppReceipt` dependency for the SDK.


### Fixes
- All readme links for the UIKit example app now work.
- Adds an `experiment` parameter to `PaywallInfo`. This will be useful in the next version of Triggers, where you can see details about the experiment that triggered the presentation of the paywall.
- When triggering or presenting a paywall, if the default value for `isPresented` was `true`, the paywall would not present/trigger. It now works as expected.
