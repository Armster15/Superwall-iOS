# Contributing to Paywall

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible, and actively welcome your pull requests. If you run into problems,
please open an issue on GitHub.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints (see below).
6. Tag @jakemore, @anglinb, and @yusuftor in the pull request.

## Coding Style

### Xcode Preferences
In Xcode, you'll need to set your indentation spacing to 2 spaces. You can do that by going to **Xcode â–¸ Preferences...**, then choose the **Text Editing** tab. Inside the **Display** tab, set **Indent wrapped lines by:** to **2 spaces**:

In the **Editing** tab, select **Automatically trim trailing whitespace**:

In the **Indentation** tab, set **Tab Width** and **Indent Width** to **2 spaces**:

### SwiftLint
To maintain readability and achieve code consistency, we follow the [Raywenderlich Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).
Every time a commit is pushed to GitHub, a GitHub action automatically runs [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to check for style errors. Warnings and errors will show up as Annotations under the GitHub action telling you what needs to change. Please fix these linting issues before creating a pull request.

### Documentation
- Public classes and methods must contain detailed documentation.

## Editing the code

Open the workspace from: `.swiftpm/xcode/package.xcworkspace`.

If you are editing the example app, open the `xcodeproj` directly. The advantage of this is that you can fix linting errors before committing the code. You'll need to install SwiftLint on your computer before you can do that.

## Git Workflow

We have two branches: `master` and `develop`.

All pull requests are set to merge into `develop`, with the exception of a hotfix on `master`.

When we're ready to cut a new release, we update the `sdkVersion` in [Constants.swift](/Sources/Paywall/Misc/Constants.swift) and merge `develop` into `master`. This runs some GitHub actions to tag the release, build the docs, and push to cocoapods.

## Testing

If you add new code, please make sure it gets tested! When fixing bugs, try to reproduce the bug in a unit test and then fix the test. This makes sure we never regress that issue again.
Before creating a pull request, run all unit tests by pressing **Cmd + U**. Make sure they all pass and fix any broken tests.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Example app
When editing the sample app, you can run swiftlint
