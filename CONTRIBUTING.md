## Coding Style

### Xcode Preferences
In Xcode, you'll need to set your indentation spacing to 2 spaces. You can do that by going to **Xcode â–¸ Preferences...**, then choose the **Text Editing** tab. Inside the **Display** tab, set **Indent wrapped lines by:** to **2 spaces**:

### SwiftLint
To maintain readability and achieve code consistency, we follow the [Raywenderlich Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).
Every time a commit is pushed to GitHub, a GitHub Action automatically runs [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to check for style errors. Warnings and errors will show up as Annotations under the GitHub Action telling you what needs to change. Please fix these linting issues before creating a pull request.

### Documentation
Public classes and methods must contain detailed documentation.

## Editing the code

Open the workspace from: `.swiftpm/xcode/package.xcworkspace`.

If you are editing the example app, open the example app's `xcodeproj` in `Example/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample.xcodeproj` directly. The advantage of this is that you can see linting issues on build. You'll need to install SwiftLint on your computer before you can do that.

## Git Workflow

We have two branches: `master` and `develop`.

All pull requests are set to merge into `develop`, with the exception of a hotfix on `master`.

Name your branch `feature/<feature name>` for consistency.

When we're ready to cut a new release, we update the `sdkVersion` in [Constants.swift](/Sources/Paywall/Misc/Constants.swift) and merge `develop` into `master`. This runs some GitHub actions to tag the release, build the docs, and push to cocoapods.

## Testing

If you add new code, please make sure it gets tested! When fixing bugs, try to reproduce the bug in a unit test and then fix the test. This makes sure we never regress that issue again.
Before creating a pull request, run all unit tests by pressing **Cmd + U**. Make sure they all pass and fix any broken tests.
We also have a GitHub Action that runs the tests on push.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

## Example app

When editing the sample app, you can run swiftlint
