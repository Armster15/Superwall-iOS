# SwiftUI Example App

This app demonstrates how to use Superwall's *Paywall* SDK in SwiftUI. We've written a mini tutorial below to help you understand what's going on in the app.

Usually, to integrate the SDK into your app, you first need to have created a paywall to display using the [Superwall Dashboard](https://superwall.com/dashboard). However, with this example app, we have already done that for you and provided a sample API key to get you up and running. When you integrate the SDK into your own app, you'll need to use your own API key for your own Superwall account. To do that, [sign up for a free account on Superwall](https://superwall.com/sign-up).

## Requirements

This example app uses:

- SwiftUI
- Xcode 13
- iOS 15
- Swift 5

## Getting Started

Clone or download the *Paywall* SDK from the [project home page](https://github.com/superwall-me/paywall-ios). Then, open **SuperwallSwiftUIExample.xcodeproj** in Xcode and take a look at the code inside the [SuperwallSwiftUIExample](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample) folder.

Inside the [Services](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/Services) folder, you'll see some helper classes. [PaywallService.swift](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/Services/PaywallService.swift) handles the setup and delegate methods of the SDK, and [StoreKitService.swift](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/Services/StoreKitService.swift) handles the purchasing of in-app subscriptions.

[Products.storekit](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/Products.storekit) is a StoreKit configuration file that is used to mimic the setup of real products on App Store Connect. This is so you can make test purchases within the sample app without having to set up App Store Connect. In a production app, you will need real products configured in App Store Connect but you can also use a StoreKit configuration file for testing purposes if you wish.

You'll see a few different SwiftUI files that handle the layout of the app and presenting of Paywalls.

Build and run the app and you'll see the welcome screen:

</p>

The *Paywall* SDK is [configured](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/Services/PaywallService.swift#L20) on app launch, setting an `apiKey` and `delegate`.

## Delegate methods

The SDK sends back events received from the paywall via the delegate methods in [PaywallService.swift](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/Services/PaywallService.swift). You use these methods to make and restore purchases, react to analytical events, as well as tell the SDK whether the user has an active subscription. 

## Identifying a user

On the welcome screen, enter your name in the **text field** and tap **Continue**. This saves to the user attributes using   [Paywall.setUserAttributes(_:)](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/Services/PaywallService.swift#L31). You don't need to set user attributes, but it can be useful if you want to recall information about the user on your paywall.

You'll see an overview screen:

</p>

## Showing a Paywall

Paywalls are created and enabled in the [Superwall Dashboard](https://superwall.com/dashboard) and are shown to users who don't have an active subscription. To show a paywall, you have two options: **presenting** or **triggering**.

### Presenting a Paywall 

A paywall is presented by using the `presentPaywall(isPresented:onPresent:onDismiss:onFail)` view modifier in [PresentPaywallView.swift](SuperwallSwiftUIExample/SuperwallSwiftUIExample/PresentPaywallView.swift#L36). 

The paywall assigned to the user is determined by the settings in the Superwall Dashboard. Once a user is assigned a paywall, they will continue to see the same paywall, even when the paywall is turned off, unless you reassign them to a new one.

Tap **Presenting a Paywall**. You'll see some explanatory text and a button that presents a paywall to the user:

<p align="center">

</p>

Then, tap **Present Paywall** and have a look around. You'll notice analytical delegate methods printing in the console and your name displayed in the paywall:

</p>

### Triggering a Paywall

Triggers enable you to retroactively decide where or when to show a specific paywall in your app. By using the `triggerPaywall(forEvent:withParams:shouldPresent:onPresent:onDismiss:onFail:)` view modifier, you explicitly trigger a paywall in response to an analytical event. This event is tied to a trigger that's set up on the Superwall dashboard. In this app, we have tied an active trigger on the dashboard to the imaginatively named event "MyEvent". 

Head back to the overview screen, and tap on **Triggering a Paywall**. You'll see some explanatory text and a button that triggers the paywall.

Tap the **Trigger Paywall** button and you'll see the same paywall as before come up:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6QOwDTA.png" alt="Presenting a paywall" width="220px" />
</p>

If the trigger in the dashboard wasn't active, this trigger would no longer work.

## Purchasing a product

Tap the **Continue** button in the paywall and subscribe to a product. When the paywall dismisses, try triggering or presenting a paywall. You'll notice they buttons no longer show the paywall. The paywalls are only presented to users who haven't got an active subscription. To cancel the active subscription for an app that's using a storekit configuration file for testing, delete and reinstall the app.
