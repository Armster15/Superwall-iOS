/// We can't use StoreKit 2 because:
/// 1. If there are unfinished StoreKit transaction updates on app open, only the first
///    listener is given the updates. This means that our listener can interfere with
///    the clients listener (if they're using SK2) and their transactions may not even show up!
/// 2. If the developer used an SK1 listener, their listener could finish the txns before
///    ours. Which means that we will never see the unfinished transactions or we'll see only
///    a few of them.
/// 3. The Transaction.updates listener is not reliably called for transactions made outside
///   the app. Therefore the transactions aren't always finished.
