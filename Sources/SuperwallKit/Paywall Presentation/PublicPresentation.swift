  /// An Objective-C-only method that shows a paywall to the user when: An event you provide is tied to an active trigger inside a campaign on the [Superwall Dashboard](https://superwall.com/dashboard); and the user matches a rule in the campaign. **Note**: Please use ``SuperwallKit/Superwall/setUserAttributes(_:)`` if youâ€™re using Swift.
  ///
  /// Triggers enable you to retroactively decide where or when to show a specific paywall in your app. Use this method when you want to remotely control paywall presentation in response to your own analytics event and utilize completion handlers associated with the paywall presentation state.
  ///
  /// Before using this method, you'll first need to create a campaign and add a trigger associated with the event name on the [Superwall Dashboard](https://superwall.com/dashboard).
  ///
  /// The paywall shown to the user is determined by the rules defined in the campaign. Paywalls are sticky, in that when a user is assigned a paywall within a rule, they will continue to see that paywall unless you remove the paywall from the rule.
  ///
  /// For more information, see <doc:TrackingEvents>.

  ///   -  event: The name of the event you wish to track.
  ///   - params: Optional parameters you'd like to pass with your event. These can be referenced within the rules of your campaign. Keys beginning with `$` are reserved for Superwall and will be dropped. Values can be any JSON encodable value, URLs or Dates. Arrays and dictionaries as values are not supported at this time, and will be dropped.
  ///   - products: An optional ``PaywallProducts`` object whose products replace the remotely defined paywall products. Defauls to `nil`.
  ///   - ignoreSubscriptionStatus: Presents the paywall regardless of subscription status if `true`. Defaults to `false`.
  ///   - presentationStyleOverride: A `PaywallPresentationStyle` object that overrides the presentation style of the paywall set on the dashboard. Defaults to `.none`.
  ///   - onPresent: A completion block that gets called immediately after the paywall is presented. Defaults to `nil`.  Accepts a ``PaywallInfo`` object containing information about the paywall.
  ///   - onDismiss: A completion block that gets called when the paywall is dismissed by the user, by way of purchasing, restoring or manually dismissing. Defaults to `nil`. Accepts a `Bool` that is `true` if the user purchased a product and `false` if not, a `String?` equal to the product id of the purchased product (if any) and a ``PaywallInfo`` object containing information about the paywall.
