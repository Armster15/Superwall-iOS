/// The protocol that handles Superwall's subscription-related logic.

/// By default, the Superwall SDK handles all subscription-related logic.
///
/// However, if you'd like more control, you can return a ``PurchaseController`` in
/// the delegate when configuring the SDK via
/// ``Superwall/configure(apiKey:delegate:purchaseController:options:completion:)-5y99b``.
///
/// When implementing this, you also need to set the subscription status using
/// ``Superwall/subscriptionStatus``.
///
/// To learn how to implement the ``PurchaseController`` in your app
/// and best practices, see <doc:AdvancedConfiguration>.
