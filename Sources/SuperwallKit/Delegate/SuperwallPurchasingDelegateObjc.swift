  /// - Warning: A paywall will never show if this function returns `true`.

  ///   - entitlements: An array of entitlements that your products belong to on the Superwall
  ///   dashboard. This may or may not be empty, depending on whether you've added products to
  ///   an entitlement.
  /// - Returns: A boolean that indicates whether or not the user has an active subscription.
