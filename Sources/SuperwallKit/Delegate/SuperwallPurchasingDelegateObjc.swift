/// The Objective-C only delegate protocol that handles Superwall's purchasing logic.
///
/// By default, the Superwall SDK handles all purchasing logic. However,
/// if you've implemented the ``Superwall/purchasingDelegate``,  in
/// ``Superwall/configure(apiKey:delegate:purchasingDelegate:options:)-3jysg``,
/// you'll need to handle the purchasing logic yourself.
///
/// The methods are called from the SDK to determine user subscription status and
/// purchase or restore a product.
///
/// To learn how to conform to the purchasing delegate in your app
/// and best practices, see <doc:GettingStarted>.
