# Presenting a Paywall with UIKit

Call a UIKit function to present a paywall and receive callbacks associated with the paywall presentation state.

## Overview

> Important: The paywall assigned to the user is determined by your settings in the [Superwall Dashboard](https://superwall.com/dashboard). Presented paywalls are **sticky**. This means that once a user is assigned a paywall, they will continue to see the same paywall, even when the paywall is turned off, unless you reassign them to a new one.
