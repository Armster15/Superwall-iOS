# ``Paywall``

The client SDK for [Superwall](https://superwall.com), a service that lets you remotely configure, present and iterate paywalls – helping you find winners quickly.

## Overview

Paywall makes it easy to show paywalls in your app using UIKit or SwiftUI. If you haven't already, [sign up for a free Superwall account](https://superwall.com/sign-up). Configure the SDK with your API key and show our example paywall in response to a tracked event. When you're ready to use your own paywalls, head to the Superwall dashboard and use the paywall editor to configure them. Then, create a Campaign and define conditions for when the paywalls are shown to users. You can also display information about the user on the paywall by setting ``Paywall/Paywall/userAttributes``.
