# ``Paywall``

The client SDK for [Superwall](https://superwall.com), a service that lets you remotely configure, present and iterate paywalls – helping you find winners quickly.

## Overview

Paywall makes it easy to show paywalls in your app using UIKit or SwiftUI. If you haven't already, [sign up for a free Superwall account](https://superwall.com/sign-up) to get your API key. You can then configure the SDK and present paywalls that you've set up in the Superwall dashboard. You can also trigger paywalls in response to in-app analytical events, and display information about the user on the paywall by setting ``Paywall/Paywall/userAttributes``.
